        <h1>Postponing my First Release</h1>
        <p>10/21/2019 10:36 PM</p>
        <p>I know it has only been a day since my last post, but I wanted to write a little bit about why I decided to postpone my first release.</p>
        <p>I am eager to release tracks through AWAL. Maybe even too eager. When I scheduled my first release, I mistakenly put in "Intersex", my artist name, as the songwriter instead of my full name. AWAL requires songwriters to put in their full
          names for credit. Since, I didn't do this, my release is back in the editor and can be postponed.</p>
        <p>I think I'm going to leave it there for a little while. My music is getting better with every song I write, and this is quite clear with the LP I was going to release. My music is high quality, but I feel like I can do even better,
          especially with a few years of college education in music composition and English. I wrote about this in my autobiography: English is not my first language. This means it is more difficult for me to construct flowing complex sentences that
          rhyme and have distinct rhythm. Also, I am relatively new to the software I use to make music, and I want to give it a little bit more time before I actually release anything just yet.</p>
        <p>This doesn't mean I won't be releasing anything in the near future. On the contrary, I do plan to release soon, I just feel like I can provide higher quality content if I wait some time. Also, I feel like it would be better to give the
          sync licensing team more time to license my music. In addition to this, I am looking into several other places where I can sell my music, particularly film scores, in order to make some money on the side of my usual pop music career.</p>
        <p>All this said and done, I still am anxious to have releases on the stores soon. I plan to put together at least an LP because I feel like I can get more plays if I have a few songs in an LP as opposed to just a single starting out. However
          I might change this plan if I come up with a single that is sounding really good, it might be nice to have a little example of my work before my full length album comes out.</p>
        <p>I'm looking into new artwork for my website, which I have a few visions for. I will be using the animation software I wrote to produce animations on the site which I will expand on in lyric and music videos. I am working with a visual
          artist to bring this to reality. This should be pretty awesome stuff, I really look forward to seeing how it turns out.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your patience and understanding everyone. I appreciate that you take the time to read these posts and keep updated on how my career is moving forward.</p>
