      <h1>Playlists and a New Single</h1>
      <p>12/9/20 9:09 PM</p>
      <p>I have some exciting news for you today. I have put together two Spotify playlists, as well as a new single which will be released December 17. This single required some modifications from the original version to be released on the stores, which I suppose is an issue with music which I might run into in the future as well. All the more reason to release early!</p>
      <p>The new single, titled "Love Song" by Intersex is a ballad about life and love. It's an upbeat, happy and psychedellic tribute to relationships and love which I am sure you will enjoy. The album cover features a photograph from summer of myself.</p>

      <p>I regret that I wasn't able to release more music in 2020. I have been so busy with work and life that I haven't had much time to actually sit down and make music. Rest assured that I will focus more on this next year, and within the next few years I will have a lengthy catalog of pop songs for you to enjoy. I have a lot of ideas going through my head, but it does take me some time to actually put together my music, and it's a taxing process. This isn't easy for me. It's really rewarding though, as this year I had millions of streams and will hopefully be rewarded handsomely.</p>
      <p>On to the next topic of today, I put together some playlists for you to listen to! The links are below. There are two playlists, currently only available on Spotify. The first is a playlist I put together with some of my best songs. If you like my music, or just want something to listen to, you might like it! The second one is all of my songs. If you are interested in listening to all 50 of my songs, be my guest and give it a play! Both playlists include mostly instrumental and some pop music.</p>

      <p>I've been trying to add more detail to my autobiography and keep it updated but it's hard to make time to work on my website at the moment so I am falling behind. Please forgive me as I must say that it is far from perfect. I do intend to add much more and improve it extensiveley, along with the rest of this site, while keeping this blog updated with my progress and any new events. In a few months I'd also like to do a post about royalty calculation and the way I do it, as well as the payment run. Keep an eye out for new posts here, and if you haven't already, check out my autobiography. It has some awesome words for your brain.</p>
      <p>Thanks for kicking it this far. Stay cool.</p>
