        <h1>My First Payment Run</h1>
        <p>4/16/2020 3:52 PM</p>
        <p>Hello everyone. It has been a while since my last blog post, and I have been quite busy. I started working at a grocery store near my home, though I was laid off due to the virus. As such, I have had plenty of time to work on my music and
          plan to work on keeping this blog updated more often. I know I say that often but I really mean to.</p>
        <p>My first EP and singles were quite successful, I have over a quarter million streams and counting so far, and I have been paid for a fraction of that (around $100). This is less than I invested in the music, which is my goal. I am stil
          working on finding the most lucrative ways to invest in my music, and experimenting with the services I can find. From what I can tell, AWAL doesn't provide much to an artist like me until I get more streams and become more popular.</p>
        <p>So far, I am focusing on investing in my music on several sites including <a href="https://mymusicviral.com">My Music Viral</a> and <a href="https://projectstreamteam.com">Project Stream Team</a>. These sites offer services ranging from
          radio promotion to streaming, and I opted for several options. I paid for radio promotion for my single "Rainfall", which played on the local independant radio station here in Seattle (I will update with more detailed reports of the
          stations my song spins on when I have them in about two months). This program is for select independant artists, and I was selected to recieve radio airplay for my song. I also paid for Spotify and Tidal and streams, totalling around one
          million. In six months to a year, I will recieve the return on my investment in this music.</p>
        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6209985848112194" data-ad-slot="1127985276"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
        <p>As much as I wish busking on the street and handing out business cards was a way to get fans engaged with my music, it seems to be much more lucrative to pay for streams and radio airplay online. Eventually as I reach a higher tier in my
          record label, I will recieve more services from the label which will help get my music heard. For now, I am investing what I can to try to reach out to my fanbase and I am just beginning to see the returns. My next payment run is next month
          and I should see even more money next month.</p>
        <p>I am working on several new songs as well. I wrote a love song which I plan to schedule for release as soon as I finish singing it, and I'm still on track to put out an album by the end of this year. Depending on how things go I might wait
          and release a few more singles or another EP if I get another job, but in any case my album will be on the stores as soon as I have it finished, later this year or early next year.</p>
        <p>I plan to spend some time over the next few weeks editing my autobiography, so you're welcome to check that out. I have already made some edits and I am trying to make it more detailed and thorough. It is difficult to remember everything,
          but I feel like most of the important details have made it into this draft.</p>
        <p>Thank you for reading and supporting me. I know this time is difficult for everyone, so I wish you all well and that you find some peace and calm in the music. <3< /p>
