        <h1>Google AdSense</h1>
	      <p>12/6/2019 5:28 PM</p>
        <p>I've been updating my website over the past few days, fixing minor issues (sorry about that), updating the homepage, and adding Google AdSense. I wanted to thank the folks over at Google for letting me put AdSense ads on my website. Every page is monetized, except for the homepage on the computer. I'm leaving that one without ads to let you guys have a nice clear landing space to find my music or listen to it without interrupting you. I've put ads on the other pages and on mobile which I hope you don't mind, they shouldn't make the content any more difficult to access.</p>
        <p>Google AdSense is an advertising platform. This means that it has two sides, the publisher and the advertiser. I am now a publisher, meaning I can put ads on my website and profit from them, but I am also an advertiser, meaning that I can advertise to people as I wish with the revenue I make from this website. This will be helpful, because it will improve my brand as I gain more of a following. It's also nice to know my autobiography will make some profit. I've been working hard on it and I hope you are willing to check it out, even though it isn't finished quite yet.</p>
        <p>I'm planning on doing a YouTube livestream to talk about AdSense a bit more. YouTube might be an easier way to monetize content, but there is something to be said for display advertising on websites. They certainly drive a lot of clicks and revenue. I'm quite excited about AdSense, and am trying to think of more ways to make people aware of my website. I want to go walk around in downtown Seattle and hand out business cards with my website on them, and play my music on the street. I think people might like to see this, especially once I have more of a following. However, in anticipation of this, I will be waiting for my other two songs to be released, so people will have more content to listen to and I will be able to make more of an impact.</p>
        <p>I'm really looking forward to being more of an intersex activist, talking to people about who we are and what we are doing. I'll be going a bit more in depth on my YouTube soon about my music, talking about why I wrote it and what I'm planning for the future. It's a lot of planning at this stage, and I do have some exciting content in store for you. It's still early in the game so I want to work this out well, and make sure I have all my bases covered for making money. That's part of the reason why I wanted to put AdSense on this site.</p>
        <p>I'll be updating this blog daily, with another post about how I write a song coming tomorrow and more posts about making music later on. I'll probably link a livestream here if I do one tomorrow. Make sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBYxPib8Prl1dlF1_jScbWg">subscribe to my YouTube channel</a> for those videos. I hope you guys enjoy the livestreaming, it's more of something new that I'm trying out to see if it works. These videos won't be on my main channel, I'm just linking them on my blog for now, but I'm sure you'll find them enjoyable if you're interested in where my music is coming from and how it's made.</p>
