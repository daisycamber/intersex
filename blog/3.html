        <h1>Signing to AWAL</h1>
	      <p>10/8/2019 7:37 PM</p>
        <p>Finding a record label can be a challenging and rewarding process. There are many things to be said for the labels out there, but there is one that is truly redefining what a label is. AWAL is a label collective of record labels: Each artist has their own label. We share profits with the collective in exchange for sync licensing services and promotion. I decided to sign to AWAL with the label name Intersex for both of these benifits. Promotion means I will have more traffic to this site and more interest in my music. Sync licensing will help get my music where it should be played, whatever media.</p>
        <p>Signing to a record label is rewarding but it is stressful. I need to make sure all of my music is perfect before it is released, work hard to write good vocals for my album, and work on audiovisual content to go with my music. I plan to make music videos using, believe it or not, a JavaScript I wrote, which downloads frame by frame an HTML5 animation, and by directly filming myself and other people for the videos. It's a lot to work out. My content needs to be of the highest standards because Kobalt Music is funding the project, who are in turn backed by Google Ventures, Alphabet's Venture Capital company. The pressure to do great is immense, but it is also relaxing knowing I will have my music be heard. I am seeking placement in television, film, video games, and other media. Hopefully I will find what I am looking for, and if not I am also pursuing other options such as Sonata, a partner of AWAL, to find placement for my music.</p>
        <p>If nothing else I will have more written on this blog soon, it helps to write something every day just to encourage myself, and show myself that I will get through this. I am continuing to write my book as well, which has been going well, but I may need to consult people to fill in the details as my memory is still damaged. There is little I can do about this at the moment but wait, so I will continue to fill in details as I go along with it. This may mean that some of the chapters are shorter, but this isn't going to be the case forever.</p>
        <p>Otherwise I have been attending community college in Everett, Washington where I am currently living. I plan to travel as soon as I can and start touring when my album is released, which I am expecting will hopefully be around the end of 2021 or early 2022. I want to leave two years for AWAL to give my music good placement, so I won't be releasing as early as I thought originally. However, I do plan to compose more film scores and these might be released earlier or around the same time as my album under my name, Jasper Holton. I will still keep my artist name Intersex however, so people can consistently find well crafted popular music under that name. Thanks for sticking with me so far. I'll be back soon talking about how I write a song.</p>
