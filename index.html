  <p>Jasper Holton, trading as Intersex, released their first single, Humans in 2019. This modest four track debut, along with four singles and a <a href="/discography#instrumentals" title="Instrumental electronic music by Jasper Holton">handful of instrumentals</a> released afterwards, have been steadily gaining popularity online and on the radio. This growing collection of <a href="/discography#rainfall" title="New songs from Intersex on the Discography page">new songs</a> takes its inspiration from electronic and classical music, without being constrained by the boundaries of any genre.</p>
  <p>Jasper Holton was born <a href="/blog/14" title="What does intersex look like? (Intersex meaning, definition, anatomy and facts)">intersex</a>, a person who is female and male. Jasper is a singer as well as a violinist, digital artist and developer. Their music includes a multitude of upbeat anthems and fast paced, cinematic melodies, with a variety of instruments including drums, piano, guitar, synthesizer, violin, cello, and more.</p>
  <p>Here you can find songs about Jasper, love songs, and happy, uplifting and relaxing music. This is a celebration of intersex conditions, bodies and biology. Based near Seattle, Washington, Intersex is steadily rising to fame as a unique, engaging, and catchy source for new music and <a href="https://youtube.com/c/intersexmusician" title="YouTube music videos from Intersex">YouTube music videos</a>.</p>

I plan to play at local venues and tour within the next few years (when it is safe to do so) so keep an eye on this site for updates about shows. I want to use my music to strive for intersex human rights and help solve issues, as intersex people face challenges most others do not experience. I plan to do that by sharing my work with you.</p>

      <h1>Mobile Apps</h1>
      <p>1/7/2021 8:10 AM</p>
      <p>I have some exciting news to announce! I released an Android app, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intersexmusic.wordsquares" title="WordSquares, a fun, engaging and challenging word puzzle game">WordSquares</a>, and I will soon be releasing another app, OpenChords. WordSquares is a fun word puzzle game about guessing letters to make up a square of words. OpenChords is a music making app with export to MIDI and playback. WordSquares is available on the Google Play Store and OpenChords will be there soon. The apps are paid, WordSquares costs 99 cents and OpenChords will be 2.99. While these apps cost money, they are add free versions of the apps currently available on this website. This means there is more space on the screen, and you will be able to play and work without the interruption of advertisements. I'm also planning on releasing iOS versions of this app available for Apple devices in the near future.</p>
      <p>On another note, my new single, <a href="https://ditto.fm/love-song-intersex" title="The new single, "Love Song" by Intersex">"Love Song"</a> is has been released and has over 6k streams so far! I'm working on more content and I will be releasing more music this year than I did last. There is a lot I want to work on, so I might be self employed for a while so I get a chance to work on what I need to. This website, my mobile apps and my music take up a lot of my time! But they are really rewarding too.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I have some other plans in the making for more games. I am creating a more thoroughly developed 2d game, which will include my original music, unique art and sounds, and a sandbox game world filled with challenges and rewards. Keep an eye out for it! I don't have a name for it yet, and it's still a work in progress, but I will update this blog soon with more information and screenshots of the game.</p>
      <p>Thanks for making 2020 such a great year for me! I had millions of streams, thousands of website visitors, and made lots of new content. Let's make 2021 another good one.</p>
