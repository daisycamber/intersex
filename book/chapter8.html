        <h1>Chapter 8 - Wolves</h1>
	      <p>I awoke at daybreak to the sound of wolves howling in the distance. I knew there were wolves in Alaska but I had never seen one in the wild. The creatures fascinated me, so noble and powerful like the sled dog teams back in town. Most of their howling wasn't like the long, sweeping howls of the dogs. Instead it was more of a series of yips and barks, more conversational than the howling I was used to. I almost felt comforted by their presence. If they could survive out here, I could too. There was nothing stopping me.</p>
	      <p>So I burrowed my way out from underneath my shelter and picked up the rest of the rabbit. I was so hungry I wasn't even bothered by the fact that it was covered in flies. Washing it off in the river, I noticed the other two snares had caught rabbits as well. It was incredible how well the simple technology had functioned. Sitting down by the riverbead, I began to eat the rest of the rabbit, pondering what I would do next. I could follow the river down to McKinley Park, or I could veer off and try to catch more rabbits. Rabbits live near the river, so I chose to stay by the river. It was sensible: I had a fast method of travel, readily available food and water, and I knew how to make my own shelter. I just had to make it to civilization before winter.</p>
	      <p>I crossed the stream, picking up the other two rabbits. Crossing again, I placed the rabbits on the raft and pushed off again, headed down the river. I wondered if I would find myself closer to the wolf pack. I might have some competition in hunting rabbits. I also thought maybe I could share their kills as wolves killed moose and reindeer regularly in the area. If anything, wolves could always guide me to water if I had to stray away from the river. I hoped I didn't have to, I knew this was dangerous. If I ran out of food or water, I knew I would die out there.</p>
	      <p>I made my way downstream quickly as the river would take me. I stopped again before the sun set to prepare a shelter again. This time I added driftwood to my shelter to keep it upright, and from falling down on me. By laying driftwood against a tree, placing spruce branches on top of it, and adding mud to insulate, I was able to create a makeshift shelter just big enough for me to curl up inside against the tree. It wasn't comfortable, but I was feeling better than ever. I was away from the people who had attacked me, independant and free. I was on my own for the first time and it felt great.</p>
	      <p>I feasted on the first rabbit again, noticing the flavor was starting to change slightly as the meat aged. I realized the other two rabbits would rot if I wasn't careful, and I hadn't seen any other rabbits on the stream. A few holes, but nothing quite promising. I decided to dry the meat the next few days instead of travelling further down the river.</p>
