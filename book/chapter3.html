        <h1>Chapter 3 - Childhood</h1>
	      <p>I was born intersex. This meant that I was a little bit different from the other kids. I have what is in medical terms reffered to as 46XX/46XY, or tetragametic chimerism. This means that I have male and female organs, because more than two gammetes from my parents fertilized the same body. This happens quite commonly and is a genetic mutation. It is normal, but rare enough that the other kids often rejected me because they thought I was weird. My foster family discussed finding me a new foster family, possibly back in the United States. I didn't want to leave however. I loved France and I loved my home. It felt great to be healed and free and be able to enjoy a simpler time. However, it didn't last long.</p>
	      <p>Over the course of my entire life I've had trouble fitting in. I've felt like people of both sexes reject me because I am neither sex and yet both. I've also found it difficult to date because few people are truly bisexual and find intersex people interesting. This difficulty fitting in made it hard to adopt the new culture and language as my own. However, I did learn some french. I learned how to ask for what I needed, how to greet others, and most importantly how to tell people no. Unfortunatley that didn't always work out.</p>
	      <p>My foster brother was several years older than me and much stronger. We got along most of the time, but as we both got older he started to get mean. Not an angry type of mean, just a cold type of mean. He rejected me naturally just as many people did, told me I was a freak and never wanted anything to do with me. Eventually my foster parents found me badly beaten by my foster brother and some of his friends and decided I had had enough. They put me back in the foster care system, where I was placed in the care of my birth mother back in Alaska.</p>
