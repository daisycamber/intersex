        <h1>Chapter 2 - Revival</h1>
	      <p>I found myself buried below the ground in the Alaskan tundra. I couldn't move or breathe for what must have felt like hours. Quick to arrive were the federal police who were investigating the cabin suspecting criminal activity. They found the hole where I was and talked to Monica, who was very concerned that I had been attacked. They quickly dug me up and took me to a hospital where I was given artificial surrogation technology, along with medical treatment for the wounds I had. This was my last surrogate mother: My artificial womb.</p>
	      <p>As I laid in the surrogation chamber at the hospital a doctor stood over me, puzzled. It had been several days since I had been wounded and yet the wounds were not healing. They had been stitched meticulously after the shrapnel was removed, and yet instead of healing they were festering with pus. The doctor thought it must have been the dirt the wounds were in contact with. He sat down, scratching his head and thinking of what to do. He settled on ordering a prescription of a new german antibiotic that was looking promising. This antibiotic was especially useful for children as it seemed to have a low impact on the body. The doctor got up and left, dropping off the prescription. Moments later, nurses came into the room and filled my IV with the antibiotic, letting it flow into my veins killing the bacteria in my wounds.</p>
