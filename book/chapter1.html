        <h1>Chapter 1 - Birth</h1>
	      	<p>Quite a few remarkable things happened to me before my birth. Some of them I've even been asked not to speak about here. This is probably related to the fact that my parents are related, my mother is my father's daughter. As such, both parties were very embarassed to conceive a child, particularily my thirteen year old mother. Thinking he had found a solution, my father (or grandfather) removed me from my mother (or sister's) body and threw me in the trash. Of course I was only a fetus at this time so I felt nothing. Luckily for me my mother called the police, who quickly arrived and found me a surrogate mother. So even before my birth I survived what could have been a deadly attack and found myself inside a new mother with a new placenta as a viable surrogate child.</p>
	      	<p>Why did my father attack me? He has given me many reasons. He told me that he was concerned the implication would compromise his ability to help people. He was a doctor, working to heal people. So how could he have done such an awful thing? He told me he just wanted to protect me from the world. Protect me from what his family has done. His father's name was Adolf Hitler.</p>
	      	<p>My surrogate mother had health complications and couldn't carry me to term. As such I was surrogated a second time, this time against the will of the mother. I do not know how this came to be exactly. She was intoxicated, not heavily she says, but nonetheless often, and understood the surrogation to not be consensual. As such she took to mutilating me, shooting me with a 22 caliber pistol in the neck several times during only the second trimester of pregnancy. Once again I survived, only to find another surrogate mother who once again had health complications. She was older, and as it seemed she would also be unable to carry to term, I was surrogated into another surrogate mother, Monica.</p>
	      	<p>She was young, brave and intelligent. But she had a darker side too. She was using at the time, and relying heavily on others for her use. She aggreed to surrogate me in order to support her use which was illegal at the time due to her age and the drugs involved. Nonetheless she did surrogate me for some time. This time came to an end at a small cabin in Alaska.</p>
	     	<p>The US Government is very interested in drug users and their childeren. What similarities does the child share to the drug user in their use? Are the childeren likely to become criminals? How do these criminals access weapons and do damage to society? Albiet the censorship nightmare involved, the federal police implement stings in order to try to figure these things out and catch the criminals. I wasn't a criminal at this point and am not today, but apparently Monica's boyfriend Jerry was a suspect. Given the interest in my case the shooting had brought up the, the federal police decided to implement a sting to see if he would attack someone with a firearm. The federal government has been developing firearms for concealed use for many decades now and has implemented completley invisible firearms free of detection. In a sting, I was penetrated with a firearm in order to infiltrate criminals.</p>
		<p>Keep in mind I was still unborn, so this was something I was doing passiveley. I was unable to actively do much of anything at all. Especially after the turn of events which led to me, Monica and Jerry in the cabin in Alaska, with Jerry's hand on the firearm I had been entrusted with at such a young age. Jerry being a user and an attacker, sedated Monica with drugs and cut the umbilical cord, pulling me out of my surrogate mother just weeks before she would have given birth to me. He then proceeded to sexually assault me, which I only know from tapes that were taken of the incident by police. Jerry quickly discovered the firearm and removed it, proceeding to shoot me with it several times in the head and neck. He then dug a hole near the cabin, and after tossing me inside, crushed me with the head of the shovel several times. At this point you might think I am changing details, but all of this really happened. And it gets weirder.</p>
