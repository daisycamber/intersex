        <h1>Chapter 7 - Rabbits</h1>
	      <p>Alaska's original inhabitants populated the land for long before written history existed. They hunted and gathered from the land, saving food up for winter and hunting year round. I figured I could do the same thing, some of my friends had taught me how. They would hunt with their families and learned from a long standing tradition. It was this tradition that inspired me to keep travelling along the river. I had no idea how long it would take. I just knew there was no turning back now. There was no where to go behind me, and I had to keep pushing forward and find food. As I woke up I could think of several things I could eat. I could eat wild grasses, which had little human nutrition I could digest. I could eat algea, which would be a viable food source if I could find pools of it near the river. I could eat lichon from the trees, but there wasn't much of it out there. This was going to be difficult.</p>
	      <p>I got up from my bed and shivered. I hadn't slept well my first night in the wild. I felt much better as I went into the sun and drank some water. As I looked up across the shore, I could see a small rabbit poke its way out of a hole in the bank. I paused, holding perfectly still. Rabbits can be hunted, but are most easily snared. I could set up a snare to catch this rabbit, but I might not be able to stay here. It had been less than twenty four hours since I had eaten but I was still very hungry. Being as I had spent so much time building a place to sleep where I had survived, I figured it was worthwhile to stay a while and try to catch the rabbit.</p>
	      <p>I walked up and down the shore, spotting another spruce tree with exposed roots. This time I pulled a smaller, longer root from the tree and tied it into a snare. I crossed the river, wincing at the cold, watching the rabbit dart back into its hole. I attached the snare to a root near the hole and positioned it directly above the hole. I was certain I would catch the rabbit.</p>
