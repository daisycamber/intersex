        <h1>Chapter 12 - Pack</h1>
	      <b>Thank you so much for sticking with me so far everyone. These chapters are unfinished and unedited, but I appreciate your interest and support in my autobiography. Feedback is very welcome.</b>
        <p>I don't know exactly how long I spent at this camp but by the time I felt the cold setting in I knew it was too long. The search party must have given up on me as it had been at least a month since I had set up camp. I was all alone, and I would have to cross the mountains by myself in order to return to saftey. The largest piece of meat I had dried was from a hind leg, and I knew it would last me the journey if I could carry it. I had spent some time training for this and I was ready. I drank as much water as I could. I drank until I felt sick. Leaving everything behind, I lugged the large chunk of dried meat along with me, surprisingly light without any water in it.</p>
        <p>I didn't know exactly where to go, but I knew there were wolves in the park. Wolves in Alaska are hunted extensivley for their pelts, treasured luxuries among the rich. The park was a reserve, an area of protected land where it was very illegal to hunt the wolves. I figured I could follow their howls to saftey, navigating by the sun and stars if that failed. I would have to walk southeast, I didn't know how far, and I would have to find water as there was little to drink save for the rain and blueberries. Luckily I had picked this cold, rainly day to leave, so as I walked and practically dragged the dried meat behind me I drank the rainwater that fell into my mouth. Finding blueberries along the way I ate them too, hoping this would be enough to stay sufficiently hydrated.</p>
        <p>As I didn't have the time or energy to build a shelter every day, I walked all night, pausing to eat what I could. I slept in the morning through to the day, covering my eyes and using the sunlight for warmth. After several days of walking like this, I finally heard the howling of a wolfpack. I must have been close to the park at this point, as I knew a pack of wolves this large could only exist inside the protected land. I followed the howling, </p>
