        <h1>Chapter 15 - Home</h1>
        <p>Home was back with my parents in Germany. My parents were delighted to see me, though deeply upset and embarassed for what had happened to me in Alaska. My family decided it was best to keep me with them instead of somewhere else in foster care, and I implored them to keep me there as long as I could. The more I began to understand the languages they spoke the more clear to me it was what had gone wrong. By nearly thirsting and starving to death in the wild I had stunted my growth. Doctors told me that I would spend the rest of my life looking like a four year old, in fact I had turned four over the summer where I was missing in the wild.</p>
        <p>I was determined to overcome this: I knew that medical science was advanced, and I had to credit myself. I had survived months in the wilderness, I was not the dumbest kid out there. I figured doctors would give me something to fix what had been done to me, but from here the details get obscured. I'm not even sure where home was. My brain may have been damaged by what happened, so I don't know exactly what happened. For some reason I moved back to America after a while, I remember this because I lived on a farm with a foster family, and I lived there more than several years before moving back to Europe. This period of my life was rather uneventful, somewhat like a transient stage where little I can recall was said and done. I was speaking somewhat clearly, I spoke several languages fairly fluently for my age, but I could tell I was falling behind the other children, not only in my growth but in my intellectual capability too.</p>
        <p>I recall having difficulty in understanding complex conversations, difficulty reading and writing, and especially difficulty with mathematics. The only thing that came easily to me was the music I wrote. Not even the music I could read and occasionally played from memory was simple to me. This difficulty continued for many years with little change in it's extent, except by comparison to other children. I was by far one of the slowest I knew.</p>
