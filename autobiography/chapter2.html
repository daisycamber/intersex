      <h1>Chapter 2 - Revival</h1>
      <p>I spent several weeks in the hospital before I was healed enough for release. I can remember being in a lot of pain, for reasons which I will describe in the future, but I don't remember much else. Thanks to the antibiotics my wounds healed fast and well with little scarring, which meant less pain overall. I was placed in an institution in Germany after I left the hospital where I was cared for and studied. There was much to be learned from my case medically. Few people in my situation had survived at this point. I was quickly placed in a foster family once I was deemed healed, moving to France to live with the Le Saouts. My foster father was a judge, certain he would be able to make sense of the evidence in the case of the assaults once I was old enough to speak with him.</p>
      <p>Things were moving fast. By a year into my life I was able to walk and began conversing normally. I was able to see my parents and even other relatives. My mother was happy to see me always though my father was less so, feeling embarassed and worried about the case against him my conception had presented. Despite this I got along with everyone, but I felt I was different somehow. I never quite fit in with the boys or the girls. It wasn't until I started learning the language better, which was confusing as I lived where multiple languages were spoken, that I began to understand why.</p>
