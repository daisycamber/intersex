      <h1>Chapter 2 - Revival</h1>
      <p>I found myself buried below the ground in the Alaskan tundra, or maybe it was California. I don't know exactly because there are few witnesses who agree to talk to me. What I do know is I couldn't move or breathe for what must have felt like hours. Quick to arrive were the federal police who were investigating the cabin suspecting criminal activity. They found the hole where I was and talked to Monica, who was very concerned that I had been attacked. They quickly dug me up and took me to a series of hospitals where I was given artificial surrogation technology, along with medical treatment for the wounds I had. I was hospitalized in Anchorage, Seattle, and finally Houston. This was my last surrogate mother: My artificial womb.</p>
      <p>As I laid in the ICU at the hospital a doctor stood over me, puzzled. It had been several days since I had been wounded and yet the wounds were not healing. They had been stitched meticulously after the bullets were removed, and yet instead of healing they were festering with pus. The doctor thought it must have been the dirt the wounds were in contact with. He sat down, scratching his head and thinking of what to do. He settled on ordering a prescription of a new german antibiotic that was looking promising. This antibiotic was especially useful for children as it seemed to have a low impact on the body. The doctor got up and left, dropping off the prescription. Moments later, nurses came into the room and filled my IV with the antibiotic, letting it flow into my veins killing the bacteria in my wounds.</p>
      <p>I spent several weeks in the hospital before I was healed enough for release. I can remember being in a lot of pain, for reasons which I will describe in the future, but I don't remember much else. Thanks to the antibiotics my wounds healed fast and well with little scarring, which meant less pain overall. I was placed in an institution in Germany after I left the hospital where I was cared for and studied. There was much to be learned from my case medically. Few people in my situation had survived at this point. I was quickly placed in a foster family once I was deemed healed, moving to France to live with the Le Saouts. My foster father was a judge, certain he would be able to make sense of the evidence in the case of the assaults once I was old enough to speak with him.</p>
      <p>Things were moving fast. By a year into my life I was able to walk and began conversing normally. I was able to see my parents and even other relatives. My mother was happy to see me always though my father was less so, feeling embarassed and worried about the case against him my conception had presented. Despite this I got along with everyone, but I felt I was different somehow. I never quite fit in with the boys or the girls. It wasn't until I started learning the language better, which was confusing as I lived where multiple languages were spoken, that I began to understand why.</p>
