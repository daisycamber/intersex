        <h1>Chapter 18 - Space</h1>
        <b>Thank you so much for sticking with me so far everyone. These chapters are unfinished and unedited, so I sincerley appreciate your interest and support in my autobiography. Feedback is very welcome.</b>
        <p></p>
        <p>Russia was different than any other place I had lived before. I joined the police as an officer, and quickly found myself caught up in an even greater political battle than what I had experienced before. The cold war was going on, and many people were looking to the skies for their saftey as new technology flooded the spaceflight industry and brought us closer to the skies. I dreamed every day I would find a place in the sky with the others, and I did.</p>
        <p>The police had business in orbit. It was our job to keep people safe here on earth, and whatever technology we could use to do so was applicable. I found myself in months of training, for everything from high gravity to computer systems. Everything felt extremley complex to me, and I wondered how I could possibly have gotten this job in my medical condition. I had been in a coma and nearly lost my life, and now I was preparing to orbit the earth with another cosmonaut, or Russian astronaut.</p>

        <p>As far as I could tell, it was all the same to me. A job was a job. It had to get done. So when I finally sat in the copilots seat in the Soyuz capsule aboard a massive rocket, I was ready to do whatever it took to protect earth from the many conflicts underway during the cold war.</p>
        <p>The countdown was thrilling. I had always dreamed as a child that I would be a pilot, but this was more than that. I was going to space in brand new technology, the stuff that wasn't even around when my grandparents were born. There was a computer on board, something I had had few chances to use as when I was born they were still the size of a room. It's systems helped us navigate, so as the engines lit and we began to accelerate, we chased the magenta lines to align our spacecraft along the proper course. Our mission was classified, and we were docking with a military spacecraft several kilometers above us and half way around the world. The thrill was immense as the Soyuz rocket continued to accellerate, pushing us faster and faster into the atmosphere. Before I knew it we could see the curvature of the earth below us, and we continued to accelerate rapidly as the stages of the rocket fell away back to the ocean beneath us, having been attached by nothing more than explosive bolts.</p>
        <p>Chatter between the ground station and our capsule was continuous on the radio. I recall various orders to update command with sensor data manually, position the craft, and adjust thrust to make sure our course was perfect. However, the onboard computer did the bulk of the work, like good children of the magenta we simply followed its instructions all the way to a station spinning rapidly around the earth.</p>
        <p>Approaching the station, the pilot fired the front thrusters until we were moving at about ten meters per second, then one, adjusting thrust side to side to position us and finally decellerated us to centimeters per second as we gently bumped against the airlock. We updated command with our position as the capsule docked with the station and sealed the airlock. Breathing cool, stale air and still in our space suits, we opened the airlock and continued inside to the station.</p>
        <p>Chatter with command continued. We first systematically checked the station inside to make sure all was well with the systems, configured the neccesary life support for two crew members, and finally took of our space suits.</p>
        <p>We were the only crew aboard the station. The world felt small up there. We could see everything, and we were everywhere, which was the purpose of having the station in orbit: We were aboard a defense station. What happened next I can't write about here, because I am afraid it will stir up old conflict and superpowers might clash. To summarize, I made a difficult decision to protect myself and my people, and returned to earth from the station alone.</p>
        <p>I didn't know how to pilot the re-entry vehicle. I followed orders from command, oriented the craft and fired thrusters, feeling the craft falling rapidly as I slipped and charged toward the earth, and catching myself with the joystick to match the orientation I was given. Everything was effortless and weightless, and I fell faster and faster before getting up to reach the parachute. I pulled, and the parachute did not pull. I tried to jump, but everything was so weightless. I crouched above the handle and pulled as hard as I could, before falling painfully back to the seat as the parachute came undone.</p>
        <p>Falling back to earth, I finally plunged into the ocean off target on the west coast of America. I had flown well, save for leaving my crewmate behind, but the authorities were angered by what I had done. A helicopter flew by to pick me up, and I was taken to federal prison where I was held for trial. In the United States supreme court, I explained my story and was found innocent on all charges. I saw from what had happened that the Soviet Union would no longer stand, so by my birthright I opted to stay in America after I got out of court.</p>
