      <h1>Chapter 1 - Birth</h1>
      <p>I am still rewriting chapter one. Perhaps I will do this for a long time, as there is much to reconsider and details are hard to come by. For now, I will rewrite this chapter considering what I do know about my birth.</p>
      <p>I was conceived in Europe, to a mother who is the biological child of my father. Therefore I was somewhat inbred, which caused a genetic mutation, namely having female and male organs at birth, a condition called intersex. To this day, I do not know where I was born, or how. I was born early, to a young mother of only thirteen years of age, possibly somewhere in Europe. I wouldn't have survived without technology capable of sustaining my life outside of the womb, as I was born far too early.</p>
      <p>There may be more to this chapter which I cannot share yet, because of the danger that the information shared will be used to hurt people. I am still coming to understand how after my birth I gained United States citizenship, survived injury, and found home in various foster families. It is difficult to write more about these events because I simply have little memory of this time.</p>
