        <h1>Chapter 1 - Birth</h1>
        <p>I am still rewriting chapter one in my head. Perhaps I will do this for a long time, as there is much to reconsider and details are hard to come by. For now, I will rewrite this chapter considering what I do know about my birth. This isn't
          very much: I was so young when people recounted the details to me, and I have lost contact with my birth family. They didn't abandon me, I left them in order to pursue my aspirations as a musician and writer.</p>
        <p>I was conceived in Europe, to a mother who is the biological child of my father. Therefore I was somewhat inbred, which caused a genetic mutation. This mutation gave me female and male organs at birth, a condition called intersex. To this
          day, I do not know where I was born, or how. I was born early, to a young mother in her early teenage years. I wouldn't have survived without technology capable of sustaining my life outside of the womb, as I was born far too early.</p>
        <p>In short, someone tried to stop me from being born. We saw him do it too: There were cameras in the house. Removed from my mothers womb too early, I was shot with a firearm and left for dead by a man named Jerry. I was buried alive, before
          police came to the scene and found me. From that point on, my life became a challenge. I was injured, I had been attacked with weapons, but I survived. Purley thanks to advances in medical technology, I was given donor blood, a feeding tube
          and a respirator, and I pulled through. I managed to survive against all odds.</p>
        <p>I am still coming to understand how after my birth I survived injury and found home in various foster families. It is difficult to write more about these events because I simply have little memory of this time.</p>
