        <h1>Chapter 13 - Pack</h1>
	      <b>Thank you so much for sticking with me so far everyone. These chapters are unfinished and unedited, but I appreciate your interest and support in my autobiography. Feedback is very welcome.</b>
	      <p></p>
	      <p>I slept for what felt like days. I awoke to the sound of howling dangerously close to me, but I felt like I couldn't move. Every inch of my body was on fire. It felt like jumping into a pit of lava. After falling asleep again, I awoke to a bite on my neck. I thought finally the pain was over, I would die just like this, to become the flesh of a wild animal. A part of me found this to be so beautiful as my vision swam before me. I closed my eyes and clenched my teeth, whimpering with the breath I thought would be my last.</p>
        <p>The large, grey she-wolf biting my neck loosened her grip slightly. I felt myself lifted off the ground, limp in her mouth. I didn't move a muscle, I couldn't have if I wanted too. The pain was immense, and I quickly passed out. When I awoke, I was suffocating. My head was under freezing cold water face down, and with all the strenth I could I rolled over. Coughing up the water from my lungs, I began to drink, vomiting as I did so. I swallowed and vomited, swallowed more and vomited. Water. This was what I needed. I could lie here in the shallows and drink, but the water was too cold. The wolf who had carried me here was nowhere to be seen. With all the energy I could muster, I pulled myself out of the water and onto the shore. Crawling on my hands and knees like a baby, I lurched forward and hit my head. I vomited again, and quickly passed out from the pain.</p>
        <p>It was nighttime. I had no idea how many days had passed, but when I awoke, I could see a blurred grey and black shapes in front of me. I was engulfed in fur. At first I thought I had died and been reincarnated with a wolf, but I quickly realized this wasn't the case. Instead, I was sleeping next to one. I held still, petrified. I began to feel nauseated again, and I realized I needed more water. I couldn't even crawl, but I managed to push and pull myself to the riverside several meters away and plunged my head into the water. Looking to the side, I saw the she wolf get up, heard her make a sort of yipping grunt, and trot over to the water next to me to drink. As I drank I watched her out of the corner of my eye. She was beautiful, a true treasure of nature. Her long, grey hair faded to white around her belly and to black along her spine. I drank until I vomited again. I couldn't seem to hold anything down at all. I kept drinking and vomiting until I couldn't anymore, and I fell asleep with my feet in the shallows, unable to push myself any further.</p>
        <p>Sunlight beat down upon my eyes as I awoke. I felt much better, but my entire body still burned. I felt like I was going to implode. But I had bigger problems. I was cornered on the edge of a river, and I could now make out the shapes in front of me in the day light. Standing before me were four wolves, the she wolf who had carried me to the river, a much larger male wolf, darker in color than her but just as toned and muscular, and two pups no more than a few months old and no larger than me. The pups were much lighter in color than the adults, and they yipped and whined like hounds. I began to retreat slowly to the river on my hands and knees. I drank as much as I could, but I was still vomiting up liquid. My neck felt like it was sprained, but I wasn't too worried. There was little I could do about this anyway.</p>
