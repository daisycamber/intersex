      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Why do I make music? Music inspires me. Music motivates me to keep doing what I enjoy and focus on what I love. I've been making music since I can remember, and my fondest memories are of making music. I have experienced a fascinating musical journey I'd like to share with you, so I wrote a story about my life. I will share this story with you here for free.</p>
      <p>This story begins a long time ago. It is a true story as I write it and will continue, though the greatest struggle I have encountered in writing this story is the difficulty in keeping it true. Truth is relative: Truth to one person can deceive another. As such I write this story from tainted memory, to the best of my ability, in order to recount the events of my life and the lives around mine. I will omit and change some details in order to protect people, but overall this story is not fiction. For reasons I will describe later in this book, I am unable however to recount every detail perfectly. I encountered some medical complications which damaged my memory, though my memory is improving. As such, I will continue editing this story adding details as they emerge and fixing mistakes with the help of my friends and family. I will also omit details that are not relevant or simply too uncomfortable. This is not my life story, it is a story of my life.</p>
      <p>I want to tell this story for several reasons. I have seen many mistakes made during my life and made many mistakes myself, and I feel people if granted the time and freedom might learn from these mistakes and enjoy doing so. Beyond this, and in regard to these mistakes, it is a true wonder of nature that I am here today writing this story. Everything I am up against, everything I was up against during my life and even before it should have stopped me from even being able to write. And yet as I write with earnest speed I intend to deliver nothing less than the full story.</p>
      <p>I will try to keep a distinct timeline as I write this book. I'm not trying to teach you a history lesson, though there are historical figures and events relevant to my writing. I'm not trying to recount every detail to bore you. I simply want you to understand how I got here, and why I feel I must write down these words to let others konw.</p>
      <p>Finally, I want to thank several people for helping me make this book possible. I would like to thank my sister, for being there through most of these events and supporting me in and outside of my career. I would also like to thank my late father for his support and guideance in this writing. Naturally I thank my teachers as well for their lessons, support and guideance. This has been particularly helpful with my music and my writing.</p>
