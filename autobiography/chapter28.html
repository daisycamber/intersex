          <h1>Chapter 28 - Work</h1>
          <p>Things didn't start out well in the new home, and continued to get worse as time went on. A relative of Jaspers, the person who originally had the identity I use, attacked me in his home. I felt humiliated and I was in pain, and I voiced
            my concerns to little avail. Police wouldn't intervene without investigating beforehand, and there was little I could do about the attacker. After the first attack, his parents attacked me at several points as well. I knew I had to get
            out of this home too, though my mind felt so foggy it was difficult to pull it all together.</p>
          <p>I began searching for a job immediately. I knew I needed to work to be safe, but I had no idea who had attacked me or what had happened. I hoped I was safe. I went in to apply for a job at a burger restaurant in Everett, and they hired me
            on the spot. I worked the next day, a similar job to the pizza place I had worked at before. Most of my job involved serving customers, which began to bore me. However, I really wanted to get in-state tuition so I could go to school. I
            didn't want to abandon my studies so soon, even though I had to leave Hawaii to get away from my foster family and the people at school.</p>
          <p>I worked nearly every day. I got a second job, this time at a grocery store, and worked nights too. Some of my shifts together would total over fifteen hours. I was exhausted, but I still found energy for a new project. I began to make
            music, first on the computer, and then on a violin I was given. I tried to make music often, as even when I failed to make something that sounded good I felt like I was honing my talent every day. I was improving, and some of the music I
            was writing wasn't sounding half bad. I released under the artist name Jean Jasper, a few instrumental pieces I made using synthesizers I had gotten for free on the internet. The music gained some popularity, and I was motivated to make
            more. I continued working, writing and releasing music.</p>

          <p>Months later, I submitted some of my music to a record label, AWAL, to see if I could build some momentum in the industry. I was accepted with the artist name "Intersex", to my thrill and delight. It felt great to be recognized for my
            identity. I began making music in more of a pop style, writing every day and practicing my singing and breathing. It felt really good to sing, as I knew people would hear my music and enjoy it. I couldn't have asked for anything more, but
            I still knew I had to find a better place.</p>
          <p>I started school, this time with just one English class, and I began to realize I needed a better place to stay. My safety was important, as I had been attacked and my body was still fragile and healing. I couldn't stay with my foster
            family because of their attacks, so I looked for another place to stay. Things were getting worse, and I began to fear my dreams would never be realized. I worked through my struggle. I held on.</p>
          <p>Attacks perpetrated by the family I was staying with continued, and I really wanted to leave and make something better for myself. I was badly injured by the same attacker who had attacked me when I got to the home, and spent almost a
            month in the hospital. The worst part about the hospitalization was that some of the medical records showing the wounds I had incurred were almost destroyed. The attacker's father, a doctor at the local hospital, removed them from my my
            medical record. Finding no record of the wounds I had and following my insisting that I needed medical care, I was transferred to a mental hospital in the area where I spent almost two weeks before I was treated. I was beginning to
            succumb to lead poisoning, badly bleeding daily, and feeling fatigued, with difficulty eating. Finally I was treated for my wounds, and soon after I was released from the hospital.</p>
          <p>Even though I had been set back again, I was determined to build a career for myself and be stronger than this. I didn't have a home to go to that was safe, but we put locks on the doors which at least made it safer. I knew I had to get
            out soon, I just wasn't sure how as I needed to either go to school or work, I couldn't afford to do both at the same time.</p>
          <p>Things were getting better as my music was released and people started appreciating it. I started getting more respect and credibility as my songs got played on the radio and at my work. Having music and having a following is such a
            powerful thing, as it enables me to share with the world what I love and work on my own time. The many dark events in this autobiography so far may seem disconcerting, but things really were improving.</p>
