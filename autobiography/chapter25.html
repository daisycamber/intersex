          <h1>Chapter 25 - Germany</h1>
          <p>I woke up in immense pain. It was time to leave. I wasn't sure what was wrong. My whole belly hurt. I walked upstairs and noticed the zipper had moved on my bag. I didn't think anything of it. I thought I was sick, felt like I was
            bleeding but I couldn't tell where. People were in my home, seeing me goodbye, but everything was just a blur to me. I finally felt better when we got to the airport and I left my family and friends, but as soon as I began to go through
            security I knew there was some kind of problem.</p>
          <p>I walked through the metal detector, setting it off. I was quickly grabbed and knocked to my knees, and I felt cold metal against the back of my neck. Someone had a gun aimed at my brain stem, and was talking about shooting me.</p>
          <p>I don't remember the words that were said. Threats were made, but eventually the person with the gun let off and let me go, and I was told there was something inside of me. Something big, and metal. I didn't know what it was, and they
            asked me. I told them what I knew. I had been drugged. Suspicions rose.</p>

          <p>I was allowed to enter the flight, they were calling it a glitch in their machine. On board the airplane, I was told what was inside of me. And it was worse than I thought. It was a firearm. People were telling me it could be more of a
            weapon than I even thought. With uranium and a few simple parts, a gun can be a nuclear weapon. An armed drown followed close on the wingtip of the plane, protecting us. I was scared, so were others around me. Someone had attacked me with
            a weapon, trying to implicate me. This was being investigated. I told the truth, and someone volunteered to help me get it out, so I obliged. Drones followed our flight south to Anchorage. We flew on, unnacompanied, mostly in silence.</p>
          <p>I went to a hotel somewhere in the United States, where the weapon was taken out, as I couldn't bear the burden of danger. I was simply too small, and too vulnerable. I met a few familliar faces on the way to Germany, I'm not even sure
            who, but I remember they were familliar. The travel wasn't too long, and before I knew it I was in Amsterdam. The airport police told me my bag had been flagged for inspection and I followed them to watch them inspect it. They already
            knew what was there, I could tell, and I knew it was bad. After talking me through it, risks and penalties and such, they pulled a blank AR-15 reciever out of my bag. The reciever wasn't mine. I didn't know whose it was. Jerry told me he
            had repacked my bag, I didn't know what else could have happened. Someone at the party before I left must have put it there. There were a lot of people there, I didn't know many of them well.</p>
          <p>The police confiscated it from me, warned me sternly about the danger I was in, and I continued on my travels. I was not trying to bring weapons with me, but a sinking feeling in my stomach told me people were bringing weapons here. I
            didn't want this to happen, but I couldn't change the past I felt, and somehow the future. I was innocent, and I was delighted to see my new host family holding up a sign for me in Germany. They are loving, friendly people, who welcomed
            me into their house with much enthusiasm. I rode my bike around, socialized with other exchange students and the locals, and went to school. School was challenging in German, but I was learning quickly.</p>
          <p>I even ventured as far as to take the train when I felt inclined, and I met with other exchange students in various cities. It was an exhillarating experience being in a new country, and I loved nearly every moment of it. Before long, it
            was time for our Germany and Europe tour. I departed, looking forward to spending time with exchange students, taking the train to meet in Duisburg for the tour.</p>
          <p>Being on the bus was nice. It felt good to be moving and seeing new scenery. We drove a circle around Germany, visiting the major cities in this pattern. It was a fascinating time learning about history, art and architecture and staying
            in hostels, but I was missing my violin at home and playing music. I began to sing for people, on the street as we walked or when we paused. I kept taking the time to hone my talent, playing instruments as they were avialable and learning
            as I could. Before I knew it the tours were over and I was itching to travel again. I went to Amsterdam, and enjoyed the beautiful scenery and music. There were many buskers here, and I wanted to busk on the street too. People lent me
            instruments, and I even produced a few songs with other people's instruments and software. I returned to the Netherlands several times after this, every time fascinated by the culture. It was clear my family was here, though I didn't meet
            many of them.</p>
