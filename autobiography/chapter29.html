        <h1>Chapter 29 - </h1>
          <p>Things had gotten better, but they still were'nt perfect. My injuries kept me from being the person I hoped I would be. Before I even made my first payment run, something awful happened. I was driving down I5 south in Washington, on my way to Seattle. Cars stopped in  front of me, and someone pulled out a gun and shot me in the throat with it. I wasn't sure what to do. I did what I had done the last time, in Hawaii, and played dead. Eventually the attacker left and walked away, talking to someone, I quickly hit the accelerator and drove as fast as I could away. My tires were screeching and I was past the cars by the time I was in third gear, lucky to have been in a small car. I drove down the freeway as fast as I could, aware that the attacker was following me. I went faster and faster, quickly maximizing the speed of my car and driving as fast as I could safely. Finally there was traffic ahead of me and I slowed, and stopped for a police officer flashing his lights at me. I quickly explained what had happened to me and he offered to help me. He had the medical tools we needed to take the bullet out, a pair of long angled tongs, and a stapler for the skin. He placed the tongs on the bullet and I pulled it from my throat, tearing through my brain as I removed it. He stapled the wound shut and gave me gauze for my throat.</p>
          <p>I had been shot over a dozen times at this point, at least to the best of my memory. Injuries to my body could have been worse, but surviving them wasn't easy either, even after I appeared physically healed. This changed everything. All that I had done to heal myself and let my body heal from the injuries that seemed so far back had been taken away. The struggle felt so real. I fought so hard to hold on, and people tried to take my life away. It seemed so ridiculous to be hurt so many times. I wondered why people thought they could do this to someone, regardless of who it was. I regretted leaving Europe, knowing the much stricter firearms laws would have protected me.</p>
          <p>The worst part was that I found it difficult to remember things, even to remember to remember things. This was a challenge I struggled with daily. I couldn't remember to do the things that would make people around me happy with me, and I failed to do many of them. I felt like I couldn't satisfy people, like no effort that I put in would make a difference amidst what had happened.</p>
          <p>I went to the hospital and they told me my body was functioning normally, albiet some infection which had been going on for a while, even though I stayed away from attacks like this for the most part until the summer before I left for Europe. Worse, my partner didn't believe me about the things that happened, making it difficult for us to relate to each other. The hospital only released a censored version of the report from the shootings to me.</p>
          <p>I felt covered up, swept under the rug so to speak. This hurt me, because I knew what had happened, knew about the pieces of bullet still in my body, and I was nearly at the point where I could just buy the ultrasound device and see them myself. I wanted so badly to show what had happened to me, but I didn't seem to be able to. Not yet at least. I still had some time to wait before I could see that return on my investment.</p>
